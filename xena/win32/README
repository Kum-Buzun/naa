Xena requires some external applications to process certain files, such as flac for audio, readpst for outlook files and tesseract-ocr to create searchable text versions.

For Windows, we build these using Cygwin. Here is the source for each.

Install Cygwin with the usual make tools, gcc, make, etc. Also add libtiff for compressed TIFF support in tesseract-ocr.

You need to distribute the same cygwin1.dll file with the binaries, located in C:\cygwin\bin (or where ever you installed Cygwin).

libpst:
* Install the following in the Cygwin environment:
libiconv 
python
boost
boost-devel

tesseract-ocr:
*The installer should set environment variable
TESSDATA_PREFIX=C:\Program Files\National Archives of Australia\Xena\winx86
* Install the following in the Cygwin environment:
libtiff
* Include the following Cygwin dlls with binary:
cygtiff-5.dll
cygz.dll
cygtiff-5.dll
cygjpeg-62.dll
* Include the following directory from the build with binary:
tessdata/eng.unicharset

flac:
* Install the following in the Cygwin environment:
vorbis-tools
