Xena requires some external applications to process certain files, such as flac for audio, readpst for outlook files and tesseract-ocr to create searchable text versions.

For Windows, we build these using Cygwin. Here is the source for each.

Install Cygwin with the usual make tools, gcc, make, etc. Also add libtiff for compressed TIFF support in tesseract-ocr.
